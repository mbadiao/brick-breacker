<p align="center">Brick Breaker is a classic arcade game where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball upwards, breaking bricks arranged in patterns at the top. The objective is to clear all the bricks by hitting them with the ball, using the paddle to prevent the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen.</p>
